Hi, there!
This is Avani Gupta.
Welcome to my web-page.

I am an Undergraduate researcher at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad. Currently pursuing my integrated Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science at IIIT Hyderabad.
I am currently working on Neural Rendering, Neural Scene editing, and Computer graphics as my research work under Professor PJ Narayan, in CVIT. I have worked previously on NLP (Fake news detection) and Reinforcement Learning. Proficient in Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, web-dev, app-dev with demonstrated history of work.
I am passionate about building real-life applications for solving problems faced by people worldwide.

Work experience
======

* May 2021- Present: Research Intern 
  * IBM Research | Bangalore, India
===
 Research project on building system for Goal Oriented Next Best Action Prediction in Business Processes using Deep Reinforcement Learning.


* May 2020- Present: Researcher
  * CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad
===
  Working on Computer Vision and Graphics under Professor P.J. Narayan. Work involves Neural rendering, ray tracing and 3D reconstruction of objects and scenes. Working on photo-realistic reconstructions and rendering of scenes from images using Deep Neural Networks. Currently working on NeRF(Neural Radiance fields) line of work. Implemented and reproduced results of several papers in neural rendering.


* Dec 2020-Present: Independent Study and Researcher
  * CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad
  Independent Study under Professor Avinash Sharma. Working on Realistic Human Body Reconstructions and Digital Humans.


* June - July 2020: Crew Member and Mentee
  * Microsoft | Mars Colonization Program
===
  Worked on Automated mars rover web game. Developed the game in Agent Centric way. Used shortest path-finding algorithms like Collaborative Learning Agents, A*, Dijkstra, Best first search, IDA*, Jump-Point Finders and their bi-directional forms to make the AI rover navigate the mars. Applied Travelling salesmen algorithm and made the AI agent render multiple destinations in the shortest path avoiding all obstacles. Built using Object Oriented programming cocepts. Used Jquery, Rafael.js, and HTML, CSS and javascript.
 


* Jan 2020- May 2020: Applied Deep Learning and Software Engineering Intern
  * Scrapshut | Hyderabad
===
  Developed a web-app using Angular and Django where users can check genuineness of any site by providing it’s URL and get other user’s reviews along with predictions by DL model. Trained various Deep Learning models like LSTM, XGBoost and CNN on three datasets- Kaggle fake news net, Kaggle: getting real about fake news and Kaggle fake news Prediction. Also trained a passive aggressive classifier (online learning algorithm) and incorporated user-rated scraped reviews for real time prediction.


* Nov 2019- Jan 2020: RL Researcher
  * Robotics Research Centre 
===
Worked on several SOTA RL algorithms in Robotics and Control under Professor Madhav Krishna.
Implemented algorithms from Monte-Carlo to PPO, TRPO, DDPG etc from scratch. Also used open AI gym, RLib, Vowpall wabbit and engines like Gazebo, Mojuco for control in robotics.
