Hi, there!
This is Avani Gupta.
Welcome to my web-page.

I am an AI Engineer at MBZUAI, working on multi-agent learning, LLM evaluation, and agentic systems. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning interpretability, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.

* April 2024 * Jun 2025: AI Engineer
   * Stealth AI Startup | Abu Dhabi, UAE
===
      * Trained a LLM end to end from scratch for advancing SOTA: from data curation to pre-training to post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning and Alignment using RLHF) 
      *  Designed LLM with novel attention mechanism, pipelines for data generation.
      * Built an AI Assistant with various tools including advanced multi-modalretrieval,
      utilizing RAPTOR for document summaries and self-re-RAG (using LangChain, FastAPI)
      * Productionized the AI Assistant with Azure OpenAI and Google cloud.
      * Tackled multiple challenges in the AI assistant and built components like content moderation and jailbreak attempts flagging to ensure a robust deployed system.


* March 2023 * March 2024: Research Associate
   * G42 Healthcare | Abu Dhabi, UAE
===
      * Trained a foundation model from scratch in a novel setting to predict procedures,
      diagnosis and medications for patients given medical history and demographics.
