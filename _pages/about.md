Hi, there!  
This is **Avani Gupta**.  
Welcome to my webpage.

I am an **AI Engineer at MBZUAI**, working on multi-agent learning, LLM evaluation, and agentic systems. My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning interpretability**, **reinforcement learning**, and **natural language processing**.

## Jun 2025 – Present: **AI Engineer, Research Office - MBZUAI** (Abu Dhabi, UAE)
* Proposed a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) training framework (ongoing).
* Translated real-world industry challenges into research problems and connected them with faculty collaborators.
* Built intelligent agents for the Research Office: Email Assistant (prioritization, extraction, drafting, calendar integration) and automated newsletter-generation tools.
* Designed LLM-judge pipelines for QA evaluation (correctness, safety, bias) and developed persona-conditioned synthetic data generation systems for multipersona evaluations.

---

## Apr 2024 – Jun 2025: **AI Engineer - Stealth AI Startup** (Abu Dhabi, UAE)
* Trained an end-to-end LLM from scratch: data curation, pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, RLHF.
* Designed a novel attention mechanism and created pipelines for large-scale synthetic data generation.
* Built a production-grade AI Assistant with advanced multimodal retrieval (RAPTOR summaries, self-re-RAG using LangChain + FastAPI).
* Integrated Azure OpenAI + Google Cloud for scalable deployment.
* Implemented robustness features including content moderation and jailbreak detection.

---

## Mar 2023 – Mar 2024: **Research Associate - G42 Healthcare** (Abu Dhabi, UAE)
