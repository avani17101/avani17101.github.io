Hi, I’m Avani Gupta.

I draw inspiration from human learning to build efficient (both sample-efficient and generalizable), interpretable, and aligned AI systems. My research explores how *abstract conceptual knowledge* and *social learning*, two foundations of human intelligence, can be translated into autonomous agents. I am particularly interested in training paradigms for generalized open-ended learning that enable common-sense understanding of the world, while ensuring transparency, safety, and alignment with human values.

Currently, I am working as an AI Engineer in the MBZUAI Research Office, where I translate industry problems into academic research, bridging my industry experience with academic research rigor. I'm also working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/swikir/" target="_blank">Prof. Abdalla Swikir</a> on multi-agent reinforcement learning with a focus on understanding how explicit peer learning can give rise to *emergent pro-social behaviors*.

Here is my CV if you need one:
<a href="{{ '/files/Avani_Gupta_CV.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Curriculum Vitae</a>

My masters thesis: Leveraging Human-Centered Explanations for Model Improvement and Evaluation (<a href="https://ims-extr.iiit.ac.in/do.php?FdyOJIBFQDgQST7aIl74EmH/XfCoPQjtl2QYeg1lTMj4yPhOKFyf9NZq5CaQGtofPtj6jSEN3UmKNCrNygICb/mAAcO+QrDsTw3UPtC5PJWFsTzSe50Kx26BDCGEkWESc1xiLDj00ZLrOv3jAz0/yA==" target="_blank">thesis link</a>)

Research Journey:
I began my research at the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), where I completed my B.Tech (honours) and Master's by Research under my advisor <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/faculty/narayanan-p-j/" target="_blank">Prof. P. J. Narayanan</a>. I worked on human-centered abstract concept-based learning for introducing knowledge priors and interpretable control in neural networks, with applications in debiasing and removing spurious correlations (<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/c9450295fd667740a39a68148fc17f6e-Abstract-Conference.html"  target="_blank">NeurIPS 2023</a>).
During my internships at IBM Research, I worked with <a href="https://research.ibm.com/people/renuka-sindhgatta" target="_blank">Dr. Renuka Sindhgatta</a> on business process automation, where I used reinforcement learning to model next-best-action recommendations for complex organizational processes.
In my industry research roles, I worked across the full LLM training lifecycle in the clinical domain with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HD4-OxgAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Shadab Khan</a> and <a href="https://mpimentel.gitlab.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Marco Pimentel</a>, as well as on code/tools-specific LLMs. I emphasised transparency and trust in my works: from analysing clinical coherence of patient embeddings from my trained foundation models to open-source releases such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/m42-health/med42-70b">Med42</a>, a 70B clinical LLM and papers on our work.
I also built production AI assistants serving thousands of users, ensuring safety through custom moderation and jailbreak prevention.

Outside work, I maintain an active lifestyle with regular workouts and enjoy reading philosophy, scientific literature, and watching documentaries. I find flow states (or in the "zone" states) while jotting down new research ideas, practicing Kathak, and creating fine-arts (like sketching and drawing).

My motto of life?

> *Do what you believe in, do your best in whatever you do, and let outcomes follow.*
