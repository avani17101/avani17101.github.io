Hi, I’m Avani Gupta.

I draw inspiration from human learning to build AI systems that are efficient (both sample-efficient and generalizable), interpretable, and aligned. My research explores how abstract conceptual knowledge and social learning, two foundations of human intelligence, can be translated into autonomous agents. 

Currently, I am working as an AI Engineer in MBZUAI Research Office, where I translate industry problems into academic research, bridging my industry experience with academic research rigor. I'm working with Prof. Abdalla Swikir on multi-agent reinforcement learning, aiming to induce emergent pro-social behaviors in autonomous agents.

Here is my CV if you need one:

Research Journey:
I began my research at the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), where I completed my B.Tech (honours) and Master's by Research under my advisor Prof. P. J. Narayanan. My thesis focused on leveraging human-centered concepts for model improvement and evaluation (<a href="https://ims-extr.iiit.ac.in/do.php?FdyOJIBFQDgQST7aIl74EmH/XfCoPQjtl2QYeg1lTMj4yPhOKFyf9NZq5CaQGtofPtj6jSEN3UmKNCrNygICb/mAAcO+QrDsTw3UPtC5PJWFsTzSe50Kx26BDCGEkWESc1xiLDj00ZLrOv3jAz0/yA==" target="_blank">thesis link</a>), which resulted in publications at NeurIPS 2023 and a Best Paper Award at ICVGIP 2022.
During my internships at IBM Research, I worked with Dr. Renuka Sindhgatta on business process automation, where I used reinforcement learning to model next-best-action recommendations for complex organizational processes.
In my industry research roles, I worked across the full LLM training lifecycle in the clinical domain and code/tools-specific LLMs. I emphasised transparency and trust in my works: from analysing the embeddings of my trained foundation models for coherence to open-source releases like Med42 (70B clinical LLM) and papers on our work.
I also built production AI assistants serving thousands of users, ensuring safety through custom moderation and jailbreak prevention.

Outside of research, I maintain an active lifestyle with regular workouts and enjoy reading philosophy, scientific literature, and watching documentaries. I find flow states (or in the "zone" states) while jotting down new research ideas, practicing Kathak, and creating fine-arts (like sketching and drawing).
