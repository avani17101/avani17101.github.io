Hi, I’m Avani Gupta.

I take inspiration from human learning to build autonomous systems. My research aim is to build efficient (both sample-efficient and generalizable), interpretable, and aligned autonomous systems. I want to solve problems to make this world a better place for everyone and advance human understanding and knowledge. To this end, I look to contribute to the development of transparent, interpretable, and safe AI to ensure we move towards a harmonious future.

 
I aim to contribute to this beatiful world in the best ways I can. Apart from work, I am a fitness freak and try to do regular gym. In my free time, you would find me reading philosophy, scientific studies, and watching documentaries/series. I get "in the zone" or flow state while jotting new research ideas, performing kathak (in my room currently :p), and while drawing and painting.


Here is my CV if you need one:

Here is a summary of my work experiences and research so far:


I officially started my research journey from the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), where I was fortunate to work with Prof. P. J. Narayanan on interpretable-human-centered concepts for model evaluation and training. 

I was also fortunate to work with Dr. Renuka Sindhgatta on real-world problems in business process automations during my internships at IBM Research. I combined my theoretical knowledge of reinforcement learning and interpretability to model next-best-action for business processes involving KPIs optimisations and organisational processes error handling. 

In my industry research roles, I worked on the full LLM training lifecycle in the clinical domain and code/tools-specific LLMs. I emphasised transparency and trust in my works: from analysing the patient embeddings of my trained foundation models for clinical coherence to open-source releases and papers on our work. I am also grateful to have been given the opportunity to work on real-world problems involving AI Assistants in several use cases, like information retrieval, marketing content generation, and voice call analysis. I ensured the safety of my deployed agents with content moderation and jailbreak attempt prevention modules.

Currently, I am working at MBZUAI, Abu Dhabi, as an AI Engineer, where I translate real-world use cases from stakeholders to academic problem statements, bridging my industry experience with academic research rigor. I am interested in continuously improving AI and, at the courtesy of MBZUAI, am working with Prof. Abdalla Swikir on research in multi-agent reinforcement learning, where I aim to induce emergent behaviours for pro-social values in agents.

Some of my old work-ex which might been lost in my CV due to space-constraints:


* June - July 2020: Crew Member and Mentee
  * Microsoft | Mars Colonization Program
===
      * Worked on Automated mars rover web game. 
      * Developed the game in Agent Centric way. 
      * Used shortest path-finding algorithms like Collaborative Learning Agents, A*, Dijkstra, Best first search, IDA*, Jump-Point Finders and their bi-directional forms to make the AI rover navigate the mars. 
      * Applied Travelling salesmen algorithm and made the AI agent render multiple destinations in the shortest path avoiding all obstacles. *Built using Object Oriented programming cocepts. Used Jquery, Rafael.js, and HTML, CSS and javascript.
