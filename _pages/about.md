Hi, there!
This is Avani Gupta.
Welcome to my web-page.


I worked on AI research and development in building competent LLMs from scratch, improvising on not only data but model architecture. One of the models I worked on Med42: A medical LLM, is already released on huggingface. 
I researched on novel attention mechanisms for LLMs and proposed one in my current work. I have been handling model architecture development as well as synthetic data generation pipelines for pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. I have been involved in end-to-end training of LLMs: including pre-training data and scripts using deepspeed, supervised fine-tuning, DPO and RLHF.
I also developed a real-time advanced RAG system for chat support, enhancing customer interaction capabilities as an AI Engineer. I built agents with various tools including a custom retrieval agent with advanced multi-modal retrieval, utilizing RAPTOR for document summaries and self-re-RAG. I have tackled multiple challenges and built several additional components to ensure a robust system, such as content moderation and jailbreak attempt flagging. 

I worked on ML interpretability during my master's at IIIT Hyderabad and presented my paper titled "Concept Distillation: Leveraging Human-Centered Concepts for Model Improvement" in Neurips, 2023. I also published my work in ICVGIP and got the oral and best paper award. I also mentored my advisor's student in using interpretability for prevention and cure of backdoor attacks.
Previously, I worked with IBM Research on Reinforcement Learning in business processes, where I patented and published two works. With IBM Research, I created AI models for forecasting the next steps in business processes and optimizing various KPI goals for the organization. 

I am always keen to apply my skills and gather knowledge while working on interesting and novel problems. I have published my research in top AI conferences like NeurIPS, COLING, and CODS-COMAD, and I have experience in NLP, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning, being a fast learner. I look forward to joining you and contributing for important work in the field.
